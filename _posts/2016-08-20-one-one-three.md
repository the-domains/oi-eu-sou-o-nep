# One + One = Three

I spend my working life helping other people work smarter.

Every day my team and I enter organisations, identify problems and find solutions. We redesign not just how an organisation looks but how it articulates, how it flows.

For the past 25 years, I have always been designing. I've built a thriving practice, amassed an enviable number of accolades and earned the respect of my peers not to mention numerous repeat clients. By all measures, I am a success.

_But for years my private life was a mess. I was helping people work smarter. But I did not know how to live smarter. I was designing and redesigning everything but me._

It wasn't a moment of revelation so much as evolution. I can't say when it happened but it seems I hired me to help myself live better by living smarter. I began applying my principles of design to my own life. And I found my flow: I am more reflective, more alive to my senses, more in touch with the people in my life and more aware of my value. In short, I am happier.

This book is the next step in my evolution. If my design process can bring value to me as a person, perhaps it can bring value to others. Or, more radically, bring others to recognise theirown value.

**This book will not solve your problems. You have to do that yourself. And it will take lots of hard work. But I believe this book will inspire you to work better at living better.**

I am designer. I am a doer. My ultimate measure of success is achieving what I like to call doability. It's not a real word. But its meaning is manifest. This book is more than words, more than images. It's about inspiring ideas to life. It's about proving the impossible possible.
